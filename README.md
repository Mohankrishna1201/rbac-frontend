# Frontend for MERN RBAC System

This project is the frontend for a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built with React. It provides an interface for managing users, roles, and permissions, and integrates seamlessly with the backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- **User Dashboard:** View assigned roles and permissions.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage users, roles, and permissions.
- **Authentication:** Secure login and session management.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Switch between themes with consistent accent colors.
  
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**  
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Backend Integration

This frontend connects to the RBAC backend. Make sure the backend is running before starting the frontend.
